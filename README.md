# conventional-changelog-slack

A copy of [conventional-changelog-angular](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conventional-changelog-angular), but with Markdown syntax that works for a Slack message.

Slack has its own flavor of [Markdown](https://api.slack.com/reference/surfaces/formatting#basics) which sadly doesn't support certain syntax like `#` for headings or `-` for lists.

Maybe someday given enough time a conventional-changelog that outputs JSON for [Block Kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit) will be created.
